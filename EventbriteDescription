Welcome to PuPy the Puget Sound Python group. We want to build a coherent Python community in the greater Seattle area. Our inaugural meeting takes place on August 9th, with a special visit from PyLadiesSF founder Lynn Root. 

Every organization needs a culture. For the organizers of PuPy we want to start our community with an emphasis on involving more women in the community and encouraging mentorship of women interested in Python and computer science. Our inaugural meeting shall set the tone for the community. Our community through our efforts of actively involving women at the forefront of our community will increase awareness of how tech communities can create friendly space that will invite more women to participate.
